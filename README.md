# Calorie_Calculator

Making My first git project , Calculating BMI and recommending calorie requirement based on Bulking or cutting.

BMI = wight(kg)/height(m^2)

Underweight = Below 18.5 
Healthy Weight - 18.5 - 24.9
Overweight = 25 - 29.9
Obese = 30 and above

BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)

For Men: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5
For Women: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161

 TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)

 Sedentary (little/no exercise): BMR × 1.2
Lightly Active (1–3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
Moderately Active (3–5 days/week): BMR × 1.55
Very Active (6–7 days/week): BMR × 1.725
